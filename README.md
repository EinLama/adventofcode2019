# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). I'm not ambitious, but when I find the time to solve a riddle or two, I will do it.

Most solutions will start with a pragmatic and naive approach. If I find the time or the solution is too slow, I'll add optimzation commits later on.

## Dependencies

Install `bundler` and get the dependencies:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

## Tests

You can find the tests in `spec/`. You can run the tests by calling:

    bundle exec rspec

## Solutions

Every solution has a file named like the day of the challenge it will attempt to solve. Riddle input resides in the appropriate folder.

Run each solution individually:

    ruby day1.rb
